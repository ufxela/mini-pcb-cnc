# STL

The place for all the STL designs. If in a folder, then is someone else's design which I just downloaded. Huge props to designers. All doc is in the folders. Otherwise, my design.

Built for nema 17 motors using this [belt and pulley](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KY642MC) set. Use the thin belt body for the Anet A8 X Belt holder and tensioner

my stl are built for (weird) ~8.35 mm rods. Don't ask me where I got them from. I should (will?) probably redesign for 8mm rods.
